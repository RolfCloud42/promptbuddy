With the Prompt Buddy app, you get a space in Microsoft Teams where your team (or even the whole organisation) can share and discover their favourite AI prompts.  The app is preloaded with Microsoft Copilot categories but you can add your own if you've developed your own AI apps that people are using.

It's really easy to use and by giving your favourite prompts a thumbs up üëç it raises the most impactful prompts to the top of the leaderboard!

Prompt Buddy is a Teams application built on the Power Platform. 

Once installed, it can be [customized and extended](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/teams/customize-sample-apps) by the installer of the application. 

## Installing

Video tutorial for installation can be found at [Installation Demo](https://aka.ms/PromptBuddyVideo) to install the app as an unmanaged solution in Microsoft Teams. 

**_Recommended_: Install in Teams**

**This is the easiest and quickest method to get started with this app template.** The provisioning is fully automated once the process starts and may take upto 2 - 3 minutes. You will get the option to chose which Teams team you'd like to install this application in. 

If this is the first Power Apps in the team, a new Dataverse for Teams environment will be provisioned, the app installed, automatically shared with all members of the team and tabbed to the channel you pick. You will be able to [edit the app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/teams/customize-sample-apps) after installation by going to the Power Apps app.

Note that this provisions the 'unmanaged' solution in the Teams environment. This means that you can take advantage of any future updates being made to the application by reinstalling the application (follow same steps as original installation).
